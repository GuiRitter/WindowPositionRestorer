# WindowPositionRestorer

I had an issue using a notebook connected to a hub connected to 2 monitors where, after locking Windows and leaving it locked for some time, upon unlocking, all of the windows would have been moved to a random monitor or the notebook's screen.

This project stores the position of all windows in order to restore them later.
